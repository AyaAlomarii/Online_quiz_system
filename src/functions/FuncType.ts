import DataObject from 'src/models/DataObject';

export type FuncType =
  | DataObject
  | void
  | null
  | undefined
  | boolean
  | number
  | string
  | []
  | Array<FuncType>;


  /* export type FuncType =:

This line defines a type alias named FuncType using TypeScript's type keyword.
The export keyword means this type can be imported and used in other TypeScript files.
 */


/* The provided TypeScript code defines a **type alias** named `FuncType` that can represent multiple types. Let's break down what this code means:

### Code Breakdown:

```typescript
import DataObject from 'src/models/DataObject';

export type FuncType =
  | DataObject
  | void
  | null
  | undefined
  | boolean
  | number
  | string
  | []
  | Array<FuncType>;
```

### Explanation:

1. **`import DataObject from 'src/models/DataObject';`**:
   - This line imports a type, class, or interface named `DataObject` from a file located at `'src/models/DataObject'`. The `DataObject` is not defined in the provided snippet, but it is used as part of the `FuncType`.

2. **`export type FuncType =`**:
   - This line defines a **type alias** named `FuncType` using TypeScript's `type` keyword.
   - The `export` keyword means this type can be imported and used in other TypeScript files.

3. **`FuncType` Union Type**:
   - The `FuncType` is a **union type**, which means it can be **one of several types**. The `|` (pipe) symbol is used to define the different types it can represent.

   Here is what each part means:

   - **`DataObject`**: This represents the imported `DataObject` type. This could be any custom type defined in the `DataObject` file, such as a class or an interface.

   - **`void`**: Represents a `void` type, which is typically used for functions that do not return a value.

   - **`null`**: Represents the JavaScript `null` value, indicating the absence of a value.

   - **`undefined`**: Represents the JavaScript `undefined` value, indicating an uninitialized state.

   - **`boolean`**: Represents the JavaScript `boolean` type (`true` or `false`).

   - **`number`**: Represents the JavaScript `number` type (e.g., `1`, `2.5`, `-10`).

   - **`string`**: Represents the JavaScript `string` type (e.g., `"hello"`).

   - **`[]`**: Represents an empty array type. It specifically means an empty array.

   - **`Array<FuncType>`**: Represents an array of `FuncType`. This means it can be an array containing any of the types that `FuncType` can represent, which allows for nested types.

### Key Points:

- **Flexible Typing**: The `FuncType` can be **very flexible** and can represent almost any value type, including custom types (`DataObject`), primitive types (`number`, `string`, etc.), special types (`void`, `null`, `undefined`), and nested structures (`Array<FuncType>`).

- **Potential Use Cases**:
  - This type definition could be useful when dealing with functions or data structures that need to handle multiple types of input or output.
  - It allows for recursive structures, such as an array that contains other arrays or any of the other types.

### Example Usage:

Here is an example of how `FuncType` could be used:

```typescript
function exampleFunction(input: FuncType): FuncType {
  if (Array.isArray(input)) {
    return input.map(item => exampleFunction(item));  // Recursively handle nested FuncType arrays
  } else if (typeof input === 'string') {
    return input.toUpperCase();  // Handle string case
  }
  ! Handle other cases...
  return input;  // Default case
}
```

- This function accepts a parameter of type `FuncType` and returns a value of the same type. It demonstrates handling nested arrays and specific type cases.

### Conclusion

The `FuncType` type alias provides a flexible type definition that can handle a wide range of values, including custom objects, primitive types, special types, and even recursive array structures. This flexibility can be useful in scenarios where a function or data structure needs to be generic and handle multiple different types. */

?A **type alias** in TypeScript is a way to give a new name to a type. It allows you to create a more descriptive or convenient name for a type that you use frequently or for types that are complex. Type aliases are often used to simplify complex type definitions, improve code readability, and provide more meaningful names for types.

### Syntax of Type Aliases

The `type` keyword is used to create a type alias in TypeScript. Here is the basic syntax:

```typescript
type AliasName = ExistingType;
```

- **`AliasName`**: The name of the new type alias.
- **`ExistingType`**: The type that the alias represents. This can be any valid TypeScript type: primitive types (`string`, `number`, etc.), complex types (e.g., object types, union types, intersections), function types, and more.

### Examples of Type Aliases

Let's look at some examples to understand how type aliases work.

#### 1. Simple Type Alias

```typescript
type StringAlias = string;

let myName: StringAlias = "John Doe";
```

In this example:
- `StringAlias` is a type alias for the `string` type.
- `myName` is declared as a `StringAlias`, which is equivalent to a `string`.

#### 2. Union Type Alias

Type aliases can be used with union types to simplify and reuse them.

```typescript
type ID = number | string;

let userId: ID = 123;
let orderId: ID = "ORD123";
```

In this example:
- `ID` is a type alias for a union type that can be either `number` or `string`.
- Both `userId` and `orderId` are of type `ID`.

#### 3. Object Type Alias

Type aliases can represent object types, making it easier to define complex shapes.

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  isActive: boolean;
};

const newUser: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Jane Doe",
  email: "jane.doe@example.com",
  isActive: true,
};
```

In this example:
- `User` is a type alias for an object type that represents a user with properties `id`, `name`, `email`, and `isActive`.
- `newUser` is an object of type `User`.

#### 4. Function Type Alias

You can use type aliases to define function types as well.

```typescript
type GreetFunction = (name: string) => string;

const greet: GreetFunction = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;

console.log(greet("John")); // Output: Hello, John!
```

In this example:
- `GreetFunction` is a type alias for a function type that takes a `string` argument and returns a `string`.
- `greet` is a function that matches the `GreetFunction` type.

#### 5. Type Alias with Generics

Type aliases can also be used with generics to create reusable types.

```typescript
type ApiResponse<T> = {
  data: T;
  status: number;
  error?: string;
};

const response: ApiResponse<string[]> = {
  data: ["item1", "item2", "item3"],
  status: 200,
};
```

In this example:
- `ApiResponse<T>` is a generic type alias that represents a generic API response structure.
- `response` is an object of type `ApiResponse<string[]>`, where `T` is substituted with `string[]`.

### Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces

Type aliases and interfaces in TypeScript can often be used interchangeably, but they have some differences:

- **Interfaces** can be extended with other interfaces using the `extends` keyword, while **type aliases** cannot extend other types. However, type aliases can use intersection types (`&`) to achieve a similar effect.

- **Interfaces** are better suited for defining the shape of objects, especially when you want to create a more complex hierarchy or use `implements` in classes.

- **Type aliases** can represent **primitive types**, **unions**, **tuples**, **intersection types**, and more. They are more versatile when it comes to defining non-object types.

### Conclusion

Type aliases in TypeScript provide a flexible way to define and reuse types, improving code readability and maintainability. They are particularly useful for creating meaningful names for complex types, working with union or intersection types, defining function signatures, and using generics to create reusable type definitions.
